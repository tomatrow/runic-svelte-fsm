# runic-svelte-fsm

rune based version of [kenkunz/svelte-fsm](https://github.com/kenkunz/svelte-fsm) with the same api surface, but stricter typing

## Notes

- notable forks of the original lib
  - [githubnext/tiny-svelte-fsm](https://github.com/githubnext/tiny-svelte-fsm)
    - I grabbed their runtime tests
  - [svecosystem/runed](https://github.com/svecosystem/runed)
    - their FiniteStateMachine class specifically
