# runic-svelte-fsm

runae baed version of [kenkunz/svelte-fsm](https://github.com/kenkunz/svelte-fsm) with a little more typing

## Notes

- notable forks of the original lib
  - [githubnext/tiny-svelte-fsm](https://github.com/githubnext/tiny-svelte-fsm)
    - I grabbed their runtime tests, but kept the same api surface as the original lib
  - [svecosystem/runed](https://github.com/svecosystem/runed)
